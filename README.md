# About Fergus Mod

We are two men, an uncle and a nephew. We shall write a Minecraft mod.

I (the uncle) know hardly anything about Minecraft. Fergus knows nothing about programming.

## What we will try to do:
* new resource block: blueastone (in progress)
* an armour set
* tools made with the new resource
* a purse, or a bag, I don't understand just yet

## Where we are learning from:
* https://wiki.mcjty.eu/modding/index.php
* http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Resource
* name: Blue stone
* unlocalized name: bluestome
* creative tab: misc (for now)
